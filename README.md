# VU 8



## Getting started
The VU stands for VU University Amsterdam and is a broad research and education university. In addition to being a university institution, it is also a teaching hospital. These are both located in the same location. VU was founded on October 20, 1880 by Abraham Kuyper.

VU University Amsterdam is researching the rhythm of the heart and wants to use an app for this. They want to be able to take heart measurements and find out what the situation is by means of an app. This allows them to research why the heart beats a certain amount when a certain situation occurs. Because they themselves are very busy with other assignments, they have called in the HvA to help with this.

## Product vision
Our goal is to make the process of using wearable technology simple and intuitive, allowing users and professors to focus on their research and studies.

Our Mobile Android Application aims to provide a seamless and convenient experience for both users and professors by connecting wearable devices with an easy-to-use interface. The app will offer a variety of features such as real-time monitoring, data visualization, and notifications to enhance the user experience. Additionally, the app will empower professors to set up and manage wearable devices, allowing them to efficiently distribute and collect data for research and classroom use.
